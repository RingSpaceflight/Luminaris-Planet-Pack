# Cartoon-Planet-Pack
This Spaceflight Simulator planet pack is not meant to be like the rest, this one is more of a cartoon like system, the pack has all the planets currently in the game, but is missing a few textures so some planets have not changed.

# Recommendations
If you have any recommendations for the pack feel free to dm me on discord or ping me in the editing channel of the official SFS discord @ringraith93#3185

# BEFORE YOU DOWNLOAD THE PACK!
Also note that when using the pack it gives a error while opening the world, this is a issue im aware of and have tried to fix, it will not effect your game, but something to be aware of.
